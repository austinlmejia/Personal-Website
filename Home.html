      <div id = "hello"> Hello!</div> My name is Austin Mejia, and I am a freshman
      studying Computer Science at Princeton University.
      <p>
        All my life, I've been fascinated by how we as a society interact with
        technology and how it changes the way we live. How are we creating a more
        interconnected world through code? Who is being left behind by the pace of
        technology, and how can we bring them into this new world? <br> With these
        questions in mind, I plan to angle my coursework towards the interactions
        people make with software, and how we can improve accessibility.
        Additionally, my studies in dance have informed my creative ability to
        innovate and execute my ideas.
